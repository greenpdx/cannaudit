# National Marijuana Matrix

### NMM

## How to track Cannabis across different legal jurdictions? Have a chain of trust. 

When cannabis goes national, There needs to be a way to track cannabis nationally and have AAA,(Authentication, authorization, and accounting) managed at the local level (State, city, company, group) .

National Marijuana Matrix, a flow graph for the nation.  Using a block-chain CoT (Chain of Trust) a national cannabis policy can be regulated at the local level.  There needs to be a common way for all regulatory agencies to coordinate between each other and still maintain local AAA.  But the most important thing is, it is Open Source System.  

The OMM provides a model and simulation of the flow per regulatory agency that can be combined into a single flow graph. 

## ACCA Anonymous Chain Crypto Accounting
Using ACCA(Anonymous Chain Crypto Accounting) a CoT protocol creates a digital regulatory area that they control.  This allows states, cities and organizations to define what is allowed in their jurisdiction.  The protocol is defined to scale and maintains privacy of the person.  Another feature is because it uses a distributed keys, there is not a single server that is hacked.  The only public interface for the agencies are signed keys. The server and server data are public.  Even businesses can run their own CoT.

* Technology and Market Economics to follow the flow of marijuana.
* Incentives, not regulations to increase compliance and reduce crime.
* Easy to use
* Model easier to understand and locate strengths and deficiencies.
* Open Source, It is transparent, transparent creates trust.
* US Cannabis Credit, USCC is a unit of Marijuana, Crypto-Accounting.
* CannAudit is the software to do auditing.
* Anonymous Chain Cryptography, ACC, is library and protocol that does USCC transactions.
* Bank, is the entity that issues USCC. Public control of bank.

**National Marijuana Matrix** is a model that tries to represent the legal segments and flow of marijuana in America. This model not only defines a process, but also a philosophy.

**Anonymous Chain Cryptography:** ACC is a Crypto-Accounting protocol. It is a modified crypto-currency, similar to Bitcoin, but designed to create a audit trail that would the could be given to the OLCC tracking system some time in the life cycle of that marijuana. 

**US Cannabis Credit:** a unit of marijuana that is represented as a ACC token. Can be QR code or any other form of digital representation. Set annually/quarterly. 

**CannAudit:** It is not a Seed to Sale system!  It is cannabis auditing system for growers. It is designed to allow semi-anonymous transactions. It is a wallet for Oregon Cannabis Credit.  

The key to auditing is the use of Crypto-Accounting. 

This is an economic model that could be used define the economic realities of Oregon marijuana. It uses technology and economics to create a a system that is easy to use, secure, and trusted. The main idea is to use economics and incentives to audit the grow and flow of marijuana in American. Cannaudit is an Open Source protocol and library that uses Anonymous Chain Cryptography ACC, a form of crypto-currency, like Bitcoin, to do the auditing.   
The National Marijuana Matrix is a matrix of Medical v. Recreational and Personal v. Commercial marijuana with illegal and hemp activities (Measure91).  This model tries to break system os cannabis flow into components and flow making analysis easier.

The Flow is what Oregon's situation is would be if using OMM. *The expected result*
